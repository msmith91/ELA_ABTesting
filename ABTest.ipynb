    "The basis behind the A/B test is a practice in statistics where a person wants to compare a mean of some metric across two groups for similarity.  More precicely, we want to test the hypothesis that they're the same.  Contradictory results of the test would indicate that there is an underlying difference between the two groups."

    "Let's assume we have two groups, A and B (seems appropriate).  Each group is made up of people and we record their heights as $h$.  Then, the mean of the heights of people in group A might be called $\\bar{h}_A$, and for group B, $\\bar{h}_B$.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "If we then want to test the assertion that people's heights in group A are statistically similar to group B, we would want to test the hypothesis ($H_0$) that:  \n",

    "versus   \n",
    "$$H_1: \\bar{h}_A \\neq \\bar{h}_B$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to gather some details about each group:  The means ($\\bar{h}_A$, $\\bar{h}_B$) and the number of people in each group ($n_A$, $n_B$).  With these, we can calculate the sample standard deviations of the groups: ($S_A$, $S_B$) and use them to calculate our t-statistics.  The formula is   \n",
    "$$t = \\frac{\\bar{h}_A - \\bar{h}_B}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_A}{(n_A)^2} + \\frac{S_B}{(n_B)^2}}}$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we need the confidence interval ($\\alpha$) and degrees of freedom ($df$) for our test.  This is standardly:  \n",
    "$$df = n_A + n_B - 2$$   \n",
    "and   \n",
    "$$\\alpha = .05$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This would mean there's a 95% confidence that the conclusion of the test is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these facts, we can use the good-ol' t-table you probably recall from the back of your favorite intro-to-stats class to find the critical t-value from the distribution with which to compare our derived t-value.  If our derived t-value is greater than the critical one from the distribution, we conclude that our null hypothesis is false - there is a statisticaly significant difference between the two groups' average heights.  If it's less than or equal to, then we accept the null hypothesis that the group means are equal."

    "\n",
    "Now, let's put this theory to use.  First, we need some tools.  Let's create some functions that will take care of some of the algebra defined above. We're going to assume we're working with a pandas dataframe called 'df' (one of the most pouplar data-handling libraries in python for doing data science).  This dataframe object is essentially a table (rows and columns) with built in functionality.  Each column is considered a 'series' and we can perform operations on one or more series together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of demonstration, let's continue with the height example from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up - averages ($\\bar{h}$).  To get the average of the column 'height' of all the people who have A in their 'group' column, we can simply say   \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1) mean_height_a = df[df.group=='A'].height.mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Second is counts ($n$).  To get the total number of people in group A, we could do something like this   \n",
    "```\n",
    "(2) n_a = df[df.group=='A'].height.count()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the standard deviation ($S$):  \n",
    "```\n",
    "(3) std_height_a = df[df.group=='A'].height.std()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, the t-value ($t$): For this one, we're going to assume you've used the above code to generate $\\bar{h}_A$,  $\\bar{h}_B$, $S_A$, $S_B$, $n_A$, and $n_B$.  We're then going to build a function to give you back the t-score for a two-sided test:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(4) def t_value(mean1, mean2, n1, n2, sd1, sd2):\n",
    "        from math import sqrt\n",

    "        return t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, we'll need a utility for testing our t-value against the t-distribution.  We extend our knowledge from above a little bit here.  Instead of setting the alpha to a fixed point and comparing the t-value to the t-distribution at the given alpha, we will simply pass the computed t-value and the degrees of freedom to a function which returns us the probability that our computed value is less than or equal to the 'critical t-value'.  Thus, our function will return us a value that should be less than or equal to our set $\\alpha%$ for us to assert there is a difference in the means.\n",
